**CSS (patch)** demonstrates updates to the built-in CSS syntax mode that I hope
will be folded in to the app's built-in Sass extension.

I acknowledge the changes are to the "deprecated" bit of the definition, but
that bit is the bit the Sass extension relies on, so I feel it would be valuable
to make the change to the built-in CSS extension to facilitate the fix to the
Sass extension.
